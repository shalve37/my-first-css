        ✨Welcome to my very first CSS website✨
    </h1>
    <p class="firstclass"><span id="spanid">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span>is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of
        a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
        XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>
    <p class="firstclass">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
        colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
        the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
        enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting.</p>
    <p class="firstclass">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
        browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
        the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>

                Inline:
                <p class="secondclass">Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll
                    only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.

                    This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be styled individually. Managing
                    your website may become too hard if you only use inline CSS.

                    However, inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some situations. For example, in cases where you don’t
                    have access to CSS files or need to apply styles for a single element only.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="thirdid">
                Internal:
                <p class="secondclass">Internal CSS is a form of CSS using which you can add CSS to HTML documents. It
                    helps to design the layout of a single HTML web page and change the styles of a web page within HTML
                    code.</p>

            </li>
            <li id="fourthid">
                External:
                <p class="secondclass">With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can
                    be created by any text editor in your device (e.g., Notepad++).

                    This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one
                    .css file, you can change your entire site at once.</p>
